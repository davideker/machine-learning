# Inferring a Context Free Grammar

This is a first attempt at creating a <b>very</b> rudimentary machine learning project capable of inferring a context free grammar that is able to differentiate tokens. Specifically, VIN(s), phone numbers, dates and names (which is basically a catch all). While much of this could be accomplished algorithmically with regular expressions the goal is to create an unsupervised learning mechanism able to infer the production rules when exposed to a sufficient corpus of new symbols.
